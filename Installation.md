This page covers the different methods for installing Momentum firmware on your Flipper Zero.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure [qFlipper](https://github.com/qFlipper/qFlipper/releases) is closed when using [Web Updater](https://momentum-fw.dev/update/) or [Flipper Lab/App](https://lab.flipper.net/), and vice versa. Only use one installation method at a time.

### Back up your data

No, you will not lose any data installing Momentum or any other firmware on your Flipper Zero. Your data is stored *externally* on the `SD card`, not on the Flipper Zero's internal storage. However, it's always a good idea to back up your data before installing a new firmware, just in case.

> [!CAUTION]
> The `Backup` and `Restore` options in [qFlipper](https://github.com/qFlipper/qFlipper/releases)'s `Advanced Controls` tab DO NOT backup your saved files! They only backup the settings contained in the (hidden) `.int` folder. See below for viable alternatives to save what you actually care about.

There are multiple ways you could backup your important files from Flipper's SD card:
1. Open [qFlipper](https://github.com/qFlipper/qFlipper/releases), switch to the `File manager` tab, go through folders manually and save files/folders you want to keep to your computer.
2. Take out the SD card from Flipper, plug it into your computer, copy some/all files from the SD to the computer.
3. Any other method of "imaging" the FatFs partition from the SD card (Google it!).

## Installation Methods
